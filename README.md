# CFD
My computational physics code
Included are the Linear Advection Equation in 1D
Burgers Equation in 1 and 2D
I'm currently working on the Euler Equations in 1D

Slope limiters are implimented, but I'm moving them to a header file soon
The code is messy, most code is run from main() instead of being it's own function, which I need to tidy up
